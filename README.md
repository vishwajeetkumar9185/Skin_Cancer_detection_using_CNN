# Skin Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network
This repository contains code and resources related to a project on skin cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We have developed algorithms and models to distinguish between benign and malignant skin cancers. TensorFlow and Keras are used to build and create the machine learning model.
