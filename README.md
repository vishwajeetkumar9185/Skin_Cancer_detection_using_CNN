# Skin Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network
This repository contains code and resources related to a machine learning project on skin cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We have developed algorithms and models to distinguish between benign and malignant skin cancers. TensorFlow and Keras are used to build and create this machine learning model.

## ‚≠ê Introduction
Skin cancer, which is on the rise globally, is the sixth most common cancer. Normally, tissues are made up of cells, and tissues make up the skin. Consequently, cancer is caused by abnormal or unregulated cell development in connected tissues or other nearby tissues. Numerous factors, such as uv radiation exposure, a weakened immune system, a family history of the disease, and others may affect the development of cancer. These types of cell development patterns can appear in both benign and malignant tissues. Benign tumours, which are of cancerous growth, are sometimes mistaken for minor moles. Malignant tumours, on the other hand, are treated like a cancer that may spread fatally.
The three fatal forms of skin disease (SCC) are melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
One well known and well worked method is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After segmentation of dermoscopic images, the features of the affected skin cells are extracted using feature extraction technique. We propose a convolutional neural network model to detect cancerous state of a person‚Äôs skin and classify them as malignant (melanoma) and benign (non-malignant).

## ‚≠ê Problem Statement
The lack of easily accessible and reliable tools for early skin cancer detection poses a significant challenge. While traditional diagnosis methods require expertise and time, leveraging machine learning and mobile technology can offer a convenient solution. This project aims to address the gap by developing an model that empowers users to capture images of skin lesions, analyze them using a trained machine learning model, and receive prompt feedback about potential cancerous risks.

## ‚≠ê Dataset
For this i have collected datasets from KAGGLE (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000). In this blog, we are going to use the skin cancer dataset binary classification benign vs malignant. After that we need to label.
